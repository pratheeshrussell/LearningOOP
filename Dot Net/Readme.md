1. Created a DLL with base class
2. Created an application that inherits the class
3. Experimenting with different concepts  
What I think  
a) Encapsulation means holding all methods and properties inside a class  
b) inheritance means accessing public methods and properties of base class and able to include additional functions  
c) Abstraction means creating methods and properties that are accessible to public  
d) polymorphism means to override or overload a function from te base class  
e) we use the base class and derived class to create objects. These objects are what interacts between the program/user and the classes which execute them  
f) constructor, destructor are called when an object is created or destroyed
